  <p>LACOROP is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), and is governed by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. In cooperation with twenty-three school districts, LACOROP determines and meets both the career objectives of students and the labor market needs in Los Angeles County. District steering committee representatives provide direction for LACOROP programs operated within their schools. LACOROP partners with business representatives who participate on advisory committees to assure that occupational courses are based upon needs of the business or industry and to provide students with on-the-job training. LACOROP provides us with funding that covers the entrance fee for LA Regional as well as many other things. LACOROP also works with private post-secondary schools, community college districts, labor organizations, and employment agencies to help us deliver our mission. </p><br />
