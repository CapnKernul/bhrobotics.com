  <p> The Beverly Hills Education Foundation's mission is to maintain EXCELLENCE in the Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD) through a community partnership that raises revenue to supplement public funding of education. Funds raised are donated to the District to help offset budget deficits. The Beverly Hills Education Foundation (BHEF), an outgrowth of the earlier Hawthorne Fund, was formed as a State Supreme Court decision Serrano vs. Priest which equalized funding for schools. Soon after, California voters passed Proposition 13, which reduced property taxes and shifted control of all California public school budgets from the local to the state level. The Beverly Hills Education Foundation (BHEF) is governed by a Board of Directors, comprised of Beverly Hills residents, community leaders and volunteers deeply concerned about preserving the EXCELLENCE in the Beverly Hills School System. Each year BHEF continues to give a generous donation to the robotics program as well as to our mentors.</p><br />
