  <h1>Outreach</h1>
  <p>For the past eight years, Team 1515 has participated in several community outreach events. Spanning from volunteering at car shows to playing with patients at Cedar Sinai, Mortorq has consistently demonstrated a thirst for community involvement. Our enthusiastic team members have always found a spot in their heart for giving back to the community that gave them so much, and our outreach efforts seem to double each year. Organizations that MorTorq has collaborated with include the Car Show, Techno-tainment Camp, the Ronald McDonald House Charity, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Aids Project Los Angeles, Cedars Sinai Hospital, Albion Street Schools, PATH Homeless Shelter, the Salvation Army, the Darfur Dream Team, and many more.</p>

    <h2>Car Show</h2>
    <p>During past seasons, Team 1515 participated in the Classics for Charity Car Show, a charity function that raises money for a local education foundation. The team helped raise $50,000, attending corporate planning meetings, submitting ideas, and providing artwork and designs for promotional materials. The team also interacted with the community during the event. MorTorq team members worked in various booths and exhibited our robot to promote the team and FIRST. Children and adults visited us in droves, and even took turns driving one of our VEX Robots.</p>

    <h2>TechnoTainment Camp</h2>
    <p>MorTorq believes in reaching out to kids to inspire them with science and engineering. One way we do this is through presentations and assistance at PlanetBravo's Techno-tainment camp. We displayed our award-winning robot to the campers during multiple sessions of the camp and assisted with the robotics courses concentrating on the Vex platform. MorTorq has developed a strong relationship with the camp over the years and we look forward to continuing our involvement with its campers and staff.</p>

    <h2>Ronald McDonald House Charities</h2>
    <p>MorTorq has been collaborating with the Ronald McDonald House for over six years now. The team has collected several thousand recyclables over the span of several robotics seasons, and each year we use the money we raise from recycling the cans to purchase food to prepare several meals at the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Everyone on Team 1515 enjoys seeing the faces of the kids when we show up with a small VEX robot for them to play with, color pictures of robots, and talk about science with the kids.</p>

    <h2>Engineering Day</h2>
    <p>MorTorq's educational outreach is not limited to the Beverly Hills High School campus. In 2006, middle school students from all four Beverly Hills public schools competed against each other in a VEX competition designed by MorTorq members to excite them about the engineering process. In order to purchase parts, tools, and playing field material for the teams, MorTorq team members raised $4,000. A kickoff lunch was staged with 50 middle school students. At the kickoff, team leaders discussed the purpose of FIRST and rules to the VEX competition. The students had 10 weeks to build a working robot. MorTorq members came to their schools twice a week to help mentor and aid in the building process. On May 25, 2006 the VEX teams assembled in the high school gym to compete during MorTorq's first Engineering Day. Representatives from MorTorq corporate sponsors were on hand to teach the kids and their parents about engineering. The event was a huge success and resulted in a large influx of interest in the program by middle school students, their parents, and the community as a whole.</p>

    <h2>Muscular Dystrophy Association</h2>
    <p>A cause very dear to the hearts of our team members is the fight against Muscular Dystrophy, which has afflicted the life of one of our alumni. Inspired to learn more and make a difference, our team has been fundraising and spreading the word about MDA for many years. In June 2007, we organized a Spare Change Drive to raise money for The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). It was very successful and helped to raise over $1200 for the cause. In September 2007, our team was invited to participate in the Jerry Lewis Telethon for MDA, further aiding to fund necessary research. We were honored by the opportunity and were very pleased with the support we received in our fight to end MD. In 2008, Team 1515 and the BHHS Service learning class participated in the 20th annual "Shamrocks Against Dystrophy Drive,” raising about $600. This year, for the third year in a row, team members walked in the MDA Walk at CBS Studios.</p>

    <h2>K-8 School Contest</h2>
    <p>A few years ago, MorTorq began The Design-A-Robot and Design-A-Rollercoaster contests, which were very successful. The top winners got to work alongside the team members from Team 1515. Due to the quality of all the entries, BHHS Robotics decided that all entries were winners and that every student that submitted an entry would be invited to a Future Engineer Day. It was great for the team to be able to share their interest and knowledge of FIRST and engineering with younger students and also to be looked up to as role models.</p>

    <h2>Cedars Sinai Hospital &amp; Mattel Children’s Hospital</h2>
    <p>Reaching out to the younger community is an integral part of Team 1515's ideology. We spent the week before the holiday season making cards for the pediatric ward of Cedars Sinai. In past years, we have decorated the playrooms of the ward. We also went from room to room and visited all the children, giving each one their own handmade card. In addition, we had brought along a robot with the hopes of letting them see how fun robotics can be. Sadly, this year we were unable to go due to an outbreak of the flu and other diseases. Whether we can visit or not, every year MorTorq makes Christmas, Hannukah, and Valentine’s Day cards for the kids at Cedars-Sinai Hospital and Mattel’s Children’s Hospital, to lift their spirits and let them know that someone is on their side.</p>

    <h2>Horace Mann Welcome Breakfast</h2>
    <p>On September 12, 2010, the Beverly Hills High School Robotics team attended the Horace Mann "Get to Know You" Breakfast. The breakfast featured many booths, including our own. The MorTorq booth advertised new robotics programs being offered at Horace Mann this year. Team 1515 displayed its VEX robot, a robot similar to the robots that will be created in the new programs. Kids and parents alike approached the MorTorq booth and asked questions about the two programs currently made available: Middle School Robotics Team, for 6th-8th graders, and Science Olympiad, for 4th -8th graders. The kids had a blast taking turns controlling the robot and talking with the high school team members about the program. Both programs are scheduled to last 3 months, with meetings around once a week. MorTorq's president, Alex Kern (12), spoke at the event, explaining to the attendees the importance of science and technology in schools and the goal of the programs. The programs seek to introduce elementary and middle school to the world of science and technology early on, and to hopefully motivate them to want to continue on with the program until they join the high school team at BHHS. The event was a huge success, with lots of students signing up for both programs. MorTorq looks forward to a great year, full of growth and success with the Middle School Robotics Team and the Science Olympiad!</p>
