  <h2>What is <abbr>FIRST</abbr>?</h2>
  <p><abbr>FIRST</abbr> stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology. It is a multinational, non-profit organization with the intention to incorporate the many aspects of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology as an exciting and entertaining outlet for kids similar to the interest they find in sports and Facebook. FIRST allows both boys and girls in high school to compete with various other robotics teams from other schools, promoting an extremely competitive but friendly and moral building environment into a unique robot incorporated game. This yearâ€™s game is called Logo Motion is played on a 27' by 54' field, in which two alliances of 3 teams each compete against each other with the objective to score as many points as possible and hinder the other alliance from scoring points. Some ways to score points are by placing inflatable inner tubes onto scoring racks in the shape of the FIRST logo, and by deploying a separate robot, a minibot, from the host robot which must climb a 10 foot tower as fast as possible. <a href="/about/first">More About <abbr>FIRST</abbr></a>.</p>
