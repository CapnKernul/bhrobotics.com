    <h2>2009: Lunacy</h2>
    <p>The object of the game was to have robots and humans score points by shooting "balls" into trailers attached to the end of each robot. There were three different types of "balls": Moon Rocks and Empty Cells were worth two points each and Super Cells were worth 15.</p>
