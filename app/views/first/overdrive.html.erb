    <h2>2008: FIRST Overdrive</h2>
    <p>FIRST Overdrive simulated a car race with the objective of each teamâ€™s robots crossing their finish lines multiple times. Besides passing the finish line, there were track balls suspended on an overpass, which could be knocked down and pushed across the finish line to earn more points. Each time a robot finished a lap or a ball passed the finish line, the team received two points, but if the ball went over the overpass, they received 8 points. During the finale of the game, robots could attempt to place the balls back on the overpass, but they had to stay there until the end of the game.</p>
